## Adding new Features

When contributing a complex change to the kubenav repository, please discuss the change you wish to make within a Github issue with the owners of this repository before making the change.

## Development

kubenav uses [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and [Go](https://go.dev), make sure that you have the correct version installed before starting development. You can use the following commands to check your installed version:

```sh
$ flutter --version

Flutter 3.3.10 • channel stable • https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
Framework • revision 135454af32 (3 weeks ago) • 2022-12-15 07:36:55 -0800
Engine • revision 3316dd8728
Tools • Dart 2.18.6 • DevTools 2.15.0


$ go version

go version go1.19 darwin/arm64
```

### Working with the Go Code

The Go code for kubenav can be found in the `cmd` and `pkg` folder. The entrypoints for the desktop version are available in the `cmd/desktop` folder and for the mobile version they can be found in the `cmd/mobile` folder.

For the desktop version we have to compile the Go code into a C shared library. This is done via the `-buildmode c-shared` flag. We are providing a Makefile to generate the C shared libraries for all operating system. The following Make commands are available:

- `make library-windows`
- `make library-macos`
- `make library-linux`

For the mobile version we are using the [`gomobile`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Mobile) tools. They can be installed by running the following two commands:

```sh
go install golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile@latest
gomobile init
```

To build the code via the `gomobile` command the `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variables must be set. We are using NDK Version 23.2.8568313.

The Android and iOS bindings can then be build using the following Make commands:

- `make bindings-android`
- `make bindings-ios`

We are using `gofmt` to format the Go code.

### Working with the Flutter Code

We are recommending to use the [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/vs-code) extensions for development.

To sort all imports in the Dart code in a uniformly way you have to run the `flutter pub run import_sorter:main` command.

#### Add a Custom Icon

If you have to add a custom icon to the Flutter app we are using https://www.fluttericon.com. The configuration file for all existing icons can be found at `utils/images/custom-icons/config.json`.

When you add a new custom icon place the `.svg` file in the `utils/images/custom-icons` folder. Please also update the `config.json` file. The content of the generated Dart class should be placed into the `lib/utils/custom_icons.dart` file.

#### Add a new Image

To add a new image to the app, place your `.svg` file in one of the folders in the `assets` folder. To generate the corresponding `.png` files the `generate.sh` script can be used. The script uses [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) to generate the `.png` files from the `.svg` files in all the required resolutions.

#### Update Kubernetes Resources

The Kubernetes resources are autogenerated via the [swagger.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/v1.25.0/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json) provided by the Kubernetes project and adjusted afterwards. To generate the all files for the Kubernetes resources the following command can be used:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/local" openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/v1.25.0/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json \
  -g dart \
  -o /local/out/dart
```

#### Update the Icons and Splash Screen

To update the icon for the app or the splash screens the following two commands can be used:

```sh
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

The icons can be found in the `utils/images/app-icons` folder. The splash screen icons can be found in the `utils/images/splash-screen` folder.

## Release

For Linux, macOS and Windows kubenav is automatically build when a new release in the GitHub repository is created. This is done via the `.github/workflows/continuous-delivery.yaml` GitHub Action.

To create a new release for Android and iOS which can be published in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.kubenav.kubenav) and the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kubenav/id1494512160) the following workflow can be used:

1. Create a file `/android/key.properties` with the following content:

    ```
    storePassword=
    keyPassword=
    keyAlias=upload
    storeFile=
    ```

2. Update the `version` key in the `pubspec.yaml` file

3. Run `make bindings-android` and `make bindings-ios` to build the Go code for kubenav

4. Delete all old builds by running `rm -rf build`

5. Build the app for Android by running `flutter build appbundle`. The build can be found at `/build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` and must be uploaded to https://play.google.com/apps/publish

6. Build the app for iOS by running `flutter build ipa`. The build can be found at `/build/ios/archive/Runner.xcarchive` and must be opened in Xcode. In Xcode **Validate App** and **Distribute App** can be used to upload the build to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com.
