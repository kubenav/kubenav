kubenav is a mobile and desktop app to  manage Kubernetes clusters. The app provides an overview of all resources in a Kubernetes clusters, including current status information for workloads. The details view for resources provides additional information. It is possible to view logs and events or to get a shell into a container. You can also edit and delete resources or scale your workloads within the app.

The app is developed using [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com) and [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com). The frontend part of the app is implemented using TypeScript and React functional components. The backend part uses [Go mobile](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Mobile) for communication with the Kubernetes API server and Cloud Providers. So it is possible to achieve nearly 100% code sharing between the mobile and desktop implementation of kubenav.

## Features

- **Available for mobile and desktop:** kubenav provides the same experience for mobile and desktop, with nearly 100% code sharing.
- **Manage Resources:** All major resources like Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Pods, etc. are supported.
- **Custom Resource Definitions:** View all Custom Resource Definitions and mange Custom Resources.
- **Modify Resources:** Edit and delete all available resources or scale your Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets.
- **Filter and Search:** Filter the resources by Namespace and find them by there name.
- **Status Information:** Fast overview of the status of workloads and detailed information including Events.
- **Resource Usage:** View the requests, limits and current usage of Pods and Containers.
- **Logs:** View the logs of a container or stream the logs in realtime.
- **Terminal:** Get a shell into a container, right from your phone.
- **Manage multiple Clusters:** Add multiple clusters via `kubeconfig` or your prefered Cloud Provider, including Google, AWS and Azure.

## Installation

The mobile version of kubenav can be downloaded from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kubenav/id1494512160) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.kubenav.kubenav). The desktop version for macOS, Linux and Windows can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/kubenav/kubenav/releases).

On mobile you can add your Cluster via Kubeconfig file or via your prefered Cloud Provider, including Google, AWS and Azure. You can also use OIDC for authentication. More information for the setup of your Cloud Provider visit one of the following pages:

- [Google OAuth 2.0 Configuration](https://kubenav.io/help/google-oauth2-configuration.html)
- [Microsoft Azure: Creating App Credentials](https://kubenav.io/help/microsoft-azure-creating-app-credentials.html)

On desktop kubenav will automatic load all configured clusters from the default Kubeconfig file or the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable. If you want to use another Kubeconfig file, you can start kubenav with the `-kubeconfig` Flag. You can also use the `-kubeconfig-include` and `-kubeconfig-exclude` flag to load Kubeconfig files from multiple locations by glob. The `-sync` flag can be used to write context changes back to your Kubeconfig file, so the context is also changed in your terminal.

> **Note:** kubenav is based on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) and [go-astilectron](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron), which will be downloaded on the first start of the app. Therefore the first start of the app can take a bit longer with a slow internet connection.

Similar to the [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) it is also possible to deploy kubenav to your Kubernetes cluster. More information on the deployment of kubenav to Kubernetes can be found in [`utils/kubernetes`](./utils/kubernetes) folder.

## Beta and Nightly Builds

For testing new features and faster feedback, we provide an **Beta** app via Apple Testflight and Google Play:

- [Apple Testflight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/RQUFGkHi)
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.kubenav.kubenav)

For the desktop version we are running nightly builds for the `master` branch via GitHub Action. The binaries are uploaded to the GitHub Workflow as artifact. You can select a workflow from the following page: [https://github.com/kubenav/kubenav/actions](https://github.com/kubenav/kubenav/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild+event%3Aschedule) to download the binary for your platform.

## Development

kubenav requires [Node v8.6.0](https://nodejs.org/) or later, and NPM version 5.6.0 or later (which is usually automatically installed with the required version of Node). If you have Node and NPM installed, install Ionic CLI:

```sh
npm install -g ionic
```

Besides Node, kubenav requires [Go 1.14](https://golang.org) and [Go mobile](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Mobile), which can be installed using the following commands:

```sh
go get -u golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile
go install golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile
gomobile init
```

To build the Electron version of kubenav, install the [go-astilectron-bundler](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron-bundler):

```sh
go get -u github.com/asticode/go-astilectron-bundler/...
go install github.com/asticode/go-astilectron-bundler/astilectron-bundler
```

To build the iOS version of kubenav ensure that you have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) installed. For the Android version you need the Android SDK, which can be installed via [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and the [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/). Also ensure that the `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variables are set.

Clone the repository, login to GitHub packages and install the required dependencies:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:kubenav/kubenav.git
cd kubenav

npm install
```

To use kubenav in your browser you need to build and start the server. The server listening on port `14122`:

```sh
make build-server && ./bin/server
```

Now you can start the app and open [localhost:8100](http://localhost:8100) in your browser:

```sh
ionic serve
```

You must build the kubenav project at least once before running on any native platform:

```sh
ionic build

make bindings-android
make bindings-ios
```

Every time you perform a build (e.g. `ionic build`) that changes your web directory (default: `build`), you'll need to copy those changes down to your native projects:

```sh
npx cap sync
```

The native iOS and Android projects are opened in their standard IDEs (Xcode and Android Studio, respectively). Use the IDEs to run kubenav:

```sh
npx cap open ios
npx cap open android
```

You can also run the native iOS or Android app with live reloading:

```sh
ionic capacitor run android -l --address=0.0.0.0
ionic capacitor run ios -l --address=0.0.0.0
```

To build the Electron version of kubenav run `make build-electron`. The app can be found in the `cmd/electron/output/<PLATFORM>-amd64` folder:

```sh
make build-electron
```

## Release

Every new release is created from the `master` branch. To create a new release the `version` field in the `package.json` file must be updated and a new tag must be set. This process is automated via `Makefile`:

```sh
make release-patch
make release-minor
make release-major
```

When the tag is pushed the changelog will be generated via GitHub Action and saved to the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file. When the changelog was generated a new GitHub release can be created with the following naming scheme and the changelog for the current tag as description:

```
Version <TAG> (yyyy-mm-dd)
```

After the release was created another GitHub Action is executed to create the Electron app for macOS, Linux and Windows via [go-astilectron-bundler](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron-bundler). These files are added to the corresponding release. The following files are available for each release:

- `kubenav-darwin-amd64.tar.gz`
- `kubenav-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
- `kubenav-windows-amd64.tar.gz`

The native iOS and Android app is built manually and submitted to the App Store and Google Play. To prepare the native app, run the following commands:

```sh
make bindings-android
make bindings-ios

export REACT_APP_VERSION=

ionic build

npx cap sync

npx cap open ios
npx cap open android
```

In the standard IDE for iOS and Android run a clean build and follow the steps to publish the app.
