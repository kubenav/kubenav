You can directly import your GKA clusters from Google Cloud. To import your GKE clusters you have to provide a valide **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from a Google OAuth 2.0 application. The instructions on how to configure such an application can be found in the following.

### Google OAuth 2.0 Configuration

Login to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and choose **API & Services** and then **OAuth consent screen** from the menu.

![Google OAuth 2.0 Configuration](resource:assets/help/providers-google-1.png)

Click on **EDIT APP** and add **https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform** to the **Scopes for Google APIs** section. Then save your OAuth consent screen.

![Google OAuth 2.0 Configuration](resource:assets/help/providers-google-2.png)

Select the **Credentials** item from the menu to get a new Client ID. Then click on **CREATE CREDENTIALS** and select **OAuth client ID**.

#### Web

Configure a new Web Application client and obtain a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

You must allow **${Constants.googleRedirectURI}** as a valid redirect url in the settings. Or you specify a custom redirect url while adding the provider. The redirect url should point to a site where you can easily copy the returned **code** parameter, an example html file for such a page can be found at https://github.com/kubenav/kubenav/blob/main/kubenav.io/auth/google.html.

To import your AKS clusters from Microsoft Azure your have to provide some credentials. The instructions on how to get / create these credentials can be found in the following.

### Microsoft Azure: Creating App Credentials

Login to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), you need the following information to use the Azure integration for kubenav:

- Subscription ID
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Tenant ID
- Resource Group Name

To get a Client ID, Client Secret and Tenant ID, you have to create an **App registration**, in the **Azure Active Directory**. For this go to **Azure Active Directory**, **App registrations** and create a **New registration**. You do not need to provide a Redirect URI. After the creation note download the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**.

![Microsoft Azure: Creating App Credentials](resource:assets/help/providers-azure-1.png)

Then for this **App registration** go to **Certificates & secrets** and create a new **Client secret**.

![Microsoft Azure: Creating App Credentials](resource:assets/help/providers-azure-2.png)

Then for this **App registration** go to **Manifest** and set **"oAuth2AllowImplicitFlow": true**. Then save the changed manifest.

![Microsoft Azure: Creating App Credentials](resource:assets/help/providers-azure-3.png)

Next you have to give the new **App registration** permissions to manage the above resources. For this go to **Subscriptions**, choose the subscription that you want to use with kubenav, take a note of the **Subscription ID** and then go to **Access control (IAM)** in your subscription.

![Microsoft Azure: Creating App Credentials](resource:assets/help/providers-azure-4.png)

There add a new **Role assignment** between the role **Contributor** and the **Azure AD user, group or service principal** that you just created.

This method can be used, when you want to manually configure each cluster. If your provider is not supported you can use a **Service Account** to get access to your cluster.

### Use a Service Account

If you haven't a Kubeconfig file which is compatible with kubenav or if your cloud provider isn't supported you can create a Service Account and use these credentials for the authentication.

In the first step you have to create a **ServiceAccount**, **ClusterRole** and **ClusterRoleBinding**. In the following example we create the required resources in a new Namespace named **kubenav**:

```sh
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: kubenav

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: kubenav
  namespace: kubenav

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: kubenav
  namespace: kubenav
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: ["*"]

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: kubenav
  namespace: kubenav
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: kubenav
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: kubenav
    namespace: kubenav
EOF
```

Now we have to use the created secret, which is used by the Service Account. To get the name of the secret run the following command:

```sh
export SECRET_NAME=\$(kubectl get sa --namespace kubenav kubenav -o=jsonpath='{.secrets[*].name}')
```

To get the certificate and access token to authenticate against the Kubernetes API we can run the following:

```sh
kubectl get secret \$SECRET_NAME -o=jsonpath='{.data.ca.crt}' | base64 --decode
kubectl get secret \$SECRET_NAME -o=jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode
```

The output from the first command can now be used for the **Certificate Authority Data** field and the output from the second command for the **Token** field.

The specified RBAC rules from the example provide full cluster access wihtout any restrictions. More information can be found in the Kubernets documentation: [Using RBAC Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).
